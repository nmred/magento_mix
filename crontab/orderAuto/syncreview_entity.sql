We were so happy when we learned that they even custom make bridesmaid dresses! We ended up buying the dresses here and it costed us $209.99 each including shipping and everything. We had all of them custom sized by following their very easy guide. The dresses arrived about 40 days later and they fit all the girls perfectly, it was amazing because we took our own measurements and ordered 7 dresses! They were very well made, my girls said they looked and felt even better than those in the salon, despite that each dress in the salon was $50 more expensive. They were made with fishing bones and build-in bras too, which gave the bodice a perfect shape even for small breasts.

My research into the local dress selection proved what other brides had told me â€“ dresses would either be affordable and nasty, or nice but very overpriced. I wanted beautiful, classic and reasonably priced dresses for my bridesmaids and that is what I got from Forherandforhim. Admittedly I was a bit nervous at buying online but the warmth of the testimonials and the beautiful and obviously genuine photos helped calm my fears.<br /> <br /> I took advantage of a Free Custom Measuring order that you were running which was ideal. My bridesmaids were all tall but to varying degrees and the custom measure meant that the lengths looked perfect on the day. They spoke of how beautiful, ladylike and glamourous they felt on the day.<br /> <br /> I was very impressed with the quality of the dresses and the craftsmanship evident in each seam. Equally impressive was your customer service with its quick response and helpfulness. In short â€“ I would not hesitate to recommend this site or its dresses to anyone looking for a quality product.
